Graph-Constrained Estimation and Hypothesis Tests
R software for [Grace](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Grace/)
The paper "A Significance Test for Graph-Constrained Estimation" is published on [Biometrics](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/biom.12418/abstract), and can be found on ArXiv(http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08339).

Description: Use the graph-constrained estimation (Grace) procedure to estimate graph-guided linear regression coefficients and use the Grace/GraceI/GraceR tests to perform graph-guided hypothesis tests on the association between the response and the predictors.
