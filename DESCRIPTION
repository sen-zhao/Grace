Description: Use the graph-constrained estimation (Grace) procedure (Zhao and Shojaie, 2016 <doi:10.1111/biom.12418>) to estimate graph-guided linear regression coefficients and use the Grace/GraceI/GraceR tests to perform graph-guided hypothesis tests on the association between the response and the predictors.
